Here is how the layout of the program works

We want to make events happen outside of Window.java, the only methods we need in that class are the ones that
will let us change things in the game Window (hence the name Window)

Every other game mechanic or calculation is kept to the classes of the entities, for example calculating the chance of
getting loot loot after a kill would be a method in the Enemy.java file that's called after die() (or whatever I felt
like naming that to)

The Window setup seems intimidating but the only parts of the code that you really need to concern yourself with is
after the main method past like 200 or so


Brief description of the methods found in Window.java
